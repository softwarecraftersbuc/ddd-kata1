# Domain Driven Design Kata

Practice Strategic Design and Architecture

# Strategic Design 

For an e-commerce application, define the problem space by dividing the System Domain into a set of subdomains: Core Domain, Supporting/Generic Subdomains.

- define the solution space by identifying the Bounded Contexts. The Context Map should be built to show the relationships between the Bounded Contexts.

- define the Ubiquitous Language Vocabulary used in each Bounded Context.

# Architecture

 - define the overall system architecture. Show how Contexts are going to be integrated. Apply Event Driven Architecture
